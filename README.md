# LED name tag programmer

This is a programmer for the 11x44 pixel LED name tag programmer available
e.g. [from Sertronics](https://www.sertronics-shop.de/computer/pc-peripheriegeraete/usb-gadgets/led-name-tag-11x44-pixel-usb).
The software offered there to program new messages is Windows-only and not
particularly trustworthy.

## Requirements

Python 3.x, PyQt5 and the [PyUSB](https://pypi.org/project/pyusb/) library.

## Usage

Use `design.py` to design messages.  Designs can be saved in a custom format,
edited and saved again.

From there they can also be saved in the native bytestream format (which
discards text metadata, since bitmaps are transferred to the name tag), or
directly programmed.  The `.led` bytestream files are compatible with those
generated by the BMPBadge Windows program.

Use `program.py` to directly program a previously saved bytestream file
without GUI interaction.

## Notes

There are two modes for generating a message: importing a bitmap, or text input.
Text rendering is done using Qt; it might not give the best possible results
for scalable fonts.
